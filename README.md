# A Pile of Gripes
# A Pile of Gripes

This project is a MERN project. That's right - we are using Mongo, Express, React, and Node

Purposes of this project:
There are many purposes of this project. First, everyone could use some React practice. Second, everyone needs a place to anonymously blast gripes into the internet. Sure you cold hop on any website that allows comments and drop bombs there, but no one wants you to do that.

Color Scheme:
We thought we would go nuts with the color scheme and throw consistency out the window. Here are the colors used throughout:

whitesmoke - because everyone needs a white that isn't white

rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)
